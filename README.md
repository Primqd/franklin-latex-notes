# Franklin's LaTeX Notes
My $\LaTeX$ notes on several subjects. Currently for notes on the AP Tests I self studied, but this will probably change.

Current subjects include:

1. AP Physics 1 and 2, in the form of notes on select chapters from [*Cutnell Johnson Physics 11th Edition* by David Young and Shane Stadler](https://www.amazon.com/Cutnell-Johnson-Physics-11th-Wiley/dp/1119472865/?_encoding=UTF8&pd_rd_w=ritv5&content-id=amzn1.sym.bc3ba8d1-5076-4ab7-9ba8-a5c6211e002d&pf_rd_p=bc3ba8d1-5076-4ab7-9ba8-a5c6211e002d&pf_rd_r=132-3632031-2747900&pd_rd_wg=tHN2Z&pd_rd_r=cda88640-745a-40b4-9c58-49cd99147ae0&ref_=aufs_ap_sc_dsk)
